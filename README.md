# Hashtags
Adds "hashtag to link" ability to Flarum. To be clear, this will simply look for a word which starts with "#" and turn it into a link. The link will perform a search if clicked. This does not do anything like track the popularity of hashtags. Still, it can be very helpful to be able to quick point someone to a specific search term this way: Click #puppies, and you'll find more posts on puppies.

Also you can tag a phrase or multiple keywords by using underscores in between each word. The extension will convert the underscores to spaces. For example: Click #how_to_breathe, and you'll find more posts on how to breathe.
